    <h1>Justin Tucker signs extension with Ravens</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>The best kicker in the NFL has regained his rightful spot atop the compensation board.</p>
    <p>The Baltimore Ravens and ﻿Justin Tucker﻿ have agreed to terms on a four-year extension worth $24 million with $17.5 million guaranteed, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Monday. The team later officially announced the signing.</p>
    <p>The money is well spent. Tucker owns a career field-goal conversion rate of 91.1 percent, is both a five-time All-Pro and five-time Pro Bowler, and he was named to the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 2010s.</p>
    <p>He's still drilling kicks better than the rest. The 32-year-old Tucker added to his sparkling resume by resetting the NFL's record for the longest converted field goal, crow-hopping into a 66-yard attempt inside Ford Field and skipping it off the crossbar to send the Ravens to victory and Tucker's uniform to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>Tucker's new deal returns him to the throne as the highest-paid kicker in the NFL, usurping Steelers kicker ﻿Chris Boswell﻿ just one week after Pittsburgh temporarily vaulted him to the top of the pay chart with a four-year, $20 million extension.</p>
    <p>Tucker's contract runs through the 2027 season, at which point he will be 38 years old. Baltimore is banking on Tucker's incredible consistency to continue through the majority of this decade, a wise decision at an otherwise fickle position.</p>
