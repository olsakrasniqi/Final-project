    <h1>Pep Guardiola to leave Manchester City after next season</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>Speaking at an online event organized by Brazilian financial services company XP Investimentos, it was reported he had confirmed he would leave City once his current deal ends.</p>
    <p>But ahead of our game with Arsenal on Saturday, he sought to clarify his comments, saying he would definitely take a break when he leaves City but hasn’t yet decided when that will be.</p>
    <p>“I am so delighted to answer this question,” Guardiola said.</p>
    <p>“I am not thinking of leaving after two years. I could leave in two months if the results are not good, or the organisation is tired of me, or I cannot handle better these players.</p>
    <p>“I can leave in three months like I can leave in five years.</p>
    <p>“What I said on a Zoom connection with business people in Brazil is after my period with Manchester City, I will take a break, that’s for sure.</p>
    <p>“That could be in one month, two years, three years, four years, five years.</p>
    <p>“Right now, today, I don’t have reasons to leave. I am not thinking in two seasons I am going to leave Manchester City.</p>
    <p>“I am committed to playing better, that is my target this season and I am going to try it."</p>
    <p>“That’s for sure when I am finished I will take a rest a little bit because it’s 12, 13 years with a short stop but not much stop."</p>
    <p>“After that maybe a new team after the break, or a national team if someone wants me - but I didn’t say I will finish in two years at Manchester City."</p>
