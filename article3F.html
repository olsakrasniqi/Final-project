    <h1>Kylian Mbappe joins Real Madrid on free transfer</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 26, 2025</em></p>
    <p>Real Madrid have announced the signing of Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain with the France international joining the Spanish and European champions on a five-year deal once his contract expires in the French capital at the end of June.</p>
    <p>Mbappe released a statement on social media following the announcement.</p>
    <p>"A dream come true, So happy and proud to join the club of my dream, Real Madird. Nobody can understand how excited I am right now. Can't wait to see you, Madridistas, and thanks for your unbelievable support. Â¡Hala Madrid!"</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old is currently with Les Bleus ahead of UEFA Euro 2024 and while he had been vocal in his hopes of representing his country at the Olympic Games in Paris later this summer, on Monday the Olympic squad was released without him on it.</p>
    <p>However, fresh from their unprecedented 15th UEFA Champions League success over the weekend, Real have announced the signature of Mbappe on a contract until 2029 at Santiago Bernabeu with the star reportedly taking the number 9 jersey number as he arrives PSG.</p>
    <p>"This is a dream come true and it is very emotional," he said. "I am very happy, liberated, relieved and proud. I am very excited to go to such a big club -- the best in the world. Thank you to the people who have sent me messages and to those who played a part in this. It is a great day for me, but we must return to other more rational things. I have responsibilities as France national team captain.</p>
    <p>"It is a big relief and I am very happy -- I think you can see that on my face. I played less at the end of the season and everyone knows why that was. You must adapt when you are a high-level player and that is not an excuse ahead of this Euro. I am trying to get back to my best possible form to help France triumph. A happy man is more likely to perform well than an unhappy man -- there is no excuse for past performances, though, and that will not win games."</p>
