    <h1>Arsenal to rival Tottenham for Eberechi Eze</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>Arsenal have added Eberechi Eze to their list of transfer targets, joining Tottenham in the race for the Crystal Palace star.</p>
    <p>Arsenal are tracking a number of versatile attackers this summer as they look to sign a wide player able to provide competition for Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard, and Standard Sport understands that Eze has been added to the list.</p>
    <p>As well as Eze, the Gunners’ hierarchy are also tracking Rodrygo at Real Madrid and Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon.</p>
    <p>Eze also remains of interest to long-time admirers Spurs, who have a close relationship with - and a number of key players signed to - Eze’s agency, CAA Base.</p>
    <p>He could leave Crystal Palace this summer with his contract at Selhurst Park said to contain a £68million release clause, payable in three instalments.</p>
    <p>Eze, who turns 27 on Sunday, finished the season in superb form, following up his first international goal for England against Latvia in March by scoring nine times in Palace’s last 13 games of the campaign, including the match-winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City as the Eagles lifted their first-ever major trophy at Wembley.</p>
    <p>Interest from Arsenal is pertinent given that Eze was part of their prestigious Hale End Academy until being released at the age of 13.</p>
    <p>Arsenal will announce the signing of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea in the coming days.</p>
    <p>The Gunners are paying £5m to sign the Spaniard from their London rivals. He will become their new second-choice goalkeeper after leaving the Blues, where he knew he was not part of the club’s plans moving forward.</p>
    <p>There is also an agreement in place for Arsenal to sign Brentford captain Christian Norgaard for an initial £10m plus up to £5m in add-ons.</p>
    <p>The midfielder was keen to join Arsenal as soon as he heard of their interest and is set to undergo a medical. His arrival would follow the departure of Jorginho and anticipated exit of Thomas Partey as a free agent. Both operate in the same position as Norgaard.</p>
