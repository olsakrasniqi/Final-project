    <h1>Kings to bring physicality next season</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>"We are going to hit first; you are going to feel us" - Bobby Jackson promises Kings will bring physicality and toughness next season originally appeared on Basketball Network.</p>
    <p>Last season, on paper, the Sacramento Kings had a roster that could compete for a playoff spot in the loaded West. Expectations are understandably high with a double-double machine like Domantas Sabonis anchoring the paint and an all-time midrange maestro in DeMar DeRozan.</p>
    <p>Yet, the 2024-25 season turned out to be a major disappointment, as the team ultimately finished as the ninth seed despite being the seventh-best offensively rated team.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest reasons they underachieved was that their defensive voids were too big. However, new assistant coach Bobby Jackson promises that a major shift in playing style will be on the horizon for 2025-26, and he believes the opponents will soon start to feel Sacramento's physical presence.</p>
    <p>Individually, several players stood out for the Kings last season. Sabonis led the league in rebounds, while Zach LaVine, despite joining the team midseason, scored 22.4 points per game, and DeRozan followed closely with 22.2 points per game. Thus, offensively, the talent was clearly there. However, their downfall was largely on the defensive end, where they ranked eighth worst in the league.</p>
    <p>Jackson pointed out that opponents completely overpowered the Kings and constantly exploited his team's lack of defensive toughness. Nevertheless, he believes that the narrative will change drastically in the upcoming season.</p>
    <p>"Me and Doug are defensive-mindset guards; we're going to be way better defensively. I think we're putting a lot of emphasis on picking up the ball 94 feet and pressuring and being physical. But we gotta get the right personnel to play that style of basketball," Jackson said on Mike Bibby's show "Straight Game Podcast."</p>
    <p>"We're still going to come with a mindset, you know, we are going to hit first, we're gonna touch you, you are going to feel us. We're gonna play fast, and we're gonna play exciting basketball. So, I think it's gonna be a new era of how to play the game the right way with physicality,"  he added.</p>
