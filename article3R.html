    <h1>Max Verstappen wins thrilling Canadian Grand Prix</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 26, 2025</em></p>
    <p>George Russell picked up his first win of the 2025 F1 season on Sunday, winning the Canadian Grand Prix for the Mercedes F1 Team.</p>
    <p>Russell earned the top poll position on Saturday, beating Max Verstappen by just 0.16 seconds. Though Russell started with the lead, there were five different leaders throughout the race. Russell, Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc all led at some point, but it was Russell who led when it mattered most down the stretch.</p>
    <p>But Verstappen didn't go away easily, cutting Russell's lead down to just 1.2 seconds on the 57th lap.</p>
    <p>As Verstappen tried to overtake Russell for the lead, Norris was battling with Piastri for a position on the podium in the final laps. Norris ultimately got too aggressive and crashed with his teammate, ending his day on the racetrack.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, Russell held his position in front after the caution flag to claim his first win of the season.</p>
    <p>It was a good day all around for Team Mercedes since Antonelli joined Russell on the podium, and they'll both look to carry their momentum into the Austrian Grand Prix.</p>
