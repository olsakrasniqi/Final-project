    <h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo expected to sign supermax extension with Bucks</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>When we touched on the "Giannis Antetokounmpo next team" odds earlier this summer, it was unclear whether he would even be leaving Milwaukee.</p>
    <p>As of June 4, the Bucks were -140 at DraftKings to have Giannis on their roster to start the 2025-26 season, and three teams -- the Spurs, Rockets and Raptors -- were 8-to-1 or shorter.</p>
    <p>Speaking of our June 4 takes on Antetotkounmpo and Kevin Durant, this feels like a good place to pat ourselves on the back for recommending Durant to the Rockets at +225.</p>
    <p>Three weeks later, the DK odds in this market tell us that Antetokounmpo is unlikely to leave Milwaukee this summer.</p>
    <p>The Bucks currently being priced at -500 pretty much says it all, but it's also telling that the team with the next-shortest odds to land him (the Knicks) is +600.</p>
    <p>We said in early June that we were "still a long way from Antetokounmpo -- who is under contract with the Bucks through '27-28, with a player option after the '26-27 season -- formally requesting a trade out of Milwaukee."</p>
    <p>Three weeks later, it looks like "a long way" might have been an understatement.</p>
