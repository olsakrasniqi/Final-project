    <h1>Tom Brady rumored to join Raiders ownership group</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>Tom Brady is one of the biggest names in the sports world, but he's been able to avoid discussing his role with the Las Vegas Raiders too much since joining ownership late last year. There have been rumors aplenty about how involved he's been, especially in the quarterback search.</p>
    <p>However, he recently decided to speak with Paul Gutierrez of Raiders.com, where he opened up about his role, and downplayed has much decision-making he's been involved in.</p>
    <p>"Well, I'm just a limited partner, so Mark (Davis is) the boss," Brady told Gutierrez. "And then Pete does his job and (John Spytek) does his job and, I think, we trust them to make the right decisions.</p>
    <p>"I'm there as a great sounding board for anything they want to do."</p>
    <p>Brady knows what a winning formula for a franchise looks like, and he's aware that meddling owners are not a recipe for success. Based on these comments, the legendary quarterback wants to be a support system for the front office and coaching staff without dictating how they do things.</p>
    <p>Brady didn't give too many details on what his day-to-day looks like with the Raiders, but he did admit that he's having a great time.</p>
    <p>"I've loved it," Brady said. "And, again, just trying to contribute in the ways that I can to help the team be the best they can be, on and off the field. We've got a great group of people. I love Mark. He's done an incredible job getting the team to Vegas, getting the stadium built."</p>
