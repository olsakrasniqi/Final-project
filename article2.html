    <h1>Keith Andrews appointed Brentford head coach</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 27, 2025</em></p>
    <p>The 44-year-old, who initially joined the club as set-piece coach in July 2024, was confirmed as Thomas Frank's successor on Friday.</p>
    <p>Asked how he felt about being the man to lead the Bees, Andrews said: "Pretty humbled would be the overriding feeling, honoured that I’m the person that’s been chosen to take the club into the next chapter.</p>
    <p>"I’m very appreciative of the owner, the board and the staff that have supported this decision. It’s an opportunity I feel I’m very capable of doing and ready to do.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know where to start in terms of what’s exciting me because there’s so much: the potential of the football club, the potential of the players and the potential of the staff that underpin what has brought success to this brilliant football club."</p>
    <p>Andrews continued: “It’s an amazing place to be and I’ve felt that for 12 months now. That will remain. It’s really important to me to have that vibe around the football club, that energy.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of words that are preached in sporting environments, like culture, and they’re not lived, whereas they are lived here on a daily basis. I think it’s really important to keep that humility that we have as a football club and continue to grow.”</p>
    <p>In his previous role at the club, Andrews helped the team secure one of the best set-piece records in the Premier League both offensively and defensively.</p>
    <p>The former midfielder revealed what he will be expecting from his side for next season and beyond.</p>
    <p>"I want a team that the fans feel represents them and what they want to see on a Saturday," he explained.</p>
    <p>"We want to play winning football, we want to be competitive, we want to have an edge, we want to play dynamic, relentless football but we want to be organised.</p>
    <p>“We want to have huge moments, huge games, and I think the big one is that we want to have an attitude and a relentlessness of progression. We really need to maintain that, and that’s on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>“If you do that, the rest looks after itself.”</p>
