    <h1>Bronny James selected by Lakers in NBA Draft</h1>
    <p><em>Date: June 26, 2025</em></p>
    <p>After a quiet rookie season, will Los Angeles Lakers point guard Bronny James suit up for his second consecutive Summer League appearance?</p>
    <p>James, the eldest son of 21-time All-NBA Lakers combo forward LeBron James, made league history after being selected with the No. 55 pick in the 2024 NBA draft. The James men became the first father-son duo to both play simultaneously in the league together and to suit up on the same team.</p>
    <p>The achievement is a testament to the longevity of LeBron James, who'll presumably play in a record-breaking 23rd pro season this year. </p>
    <p>Although the Bronny James draft selection was seen as a bit of a reach, L.A. head coach JJ Redick handled the move adeptly, generally playing James sparingly during blowouts but mostly letting him develop with the Lakers' NBAGL affiliate squad, the South Bay Lakers, in El Segundo.</p>
    <p>Last year, James averaged 2.3 points on .313/.281/.786 shooting splits, 0.8 assists and 0.7 rebounds in 27 contests with the Lakers proper.</p>
    <p>For South Bay's regular season, Bronny James averaged 21.9 points on .443/.380/.815 shooting splits, 5.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.9 steals.</p>
    <p>Now, the 6-foot-2 USC product has reportedly made a decision about that very item ahead of next month's 2025 Summer League in Las Vegas.</p>
